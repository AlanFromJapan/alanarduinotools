# Edit from AlanFromJapan
AVI20240403 : took Joonas code and ported it to my ATtiny85 board just to have a something that works on my board (https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/pcb-design/tree/master/RapideUSBMini). 

Thanks to him for sharing ðŸ’—!
## Changes
- Upgraded the version used of V-USB to latest (at least I think so)
- Made an eclipse project (Makefile is ignored)
- Edited the usbdrv/usbconfig.h to reflect my board setup

## Notes
This RapideUSBMini can't be programmed if plugged to a real USB plug (D+/D- used or pulled low/high) so use a "USB condom" or a very dumb charger, or use aligator clips.
